intro: "Markdown parsing in Gatsby is done with gatsby-transformer-remark, which uses the excellent remark under the hood.
Alongside remark we also use gatsby-remark-smartypants, which provides smart punctuation through retext-smartypants."

Thatâ€™s gatsby-remark-autolink-headers hooking up all MarkdownRemark headers with anchor links for us."
