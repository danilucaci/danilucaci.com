I decided to design this app as each time I tried to find and book a movie, all the websites and apps that I used had outdated designs, no real benefit to their membership plans and very limited searching and filtering features.

Therefore, I decided to see how I could improve the movie searching and booking experience.

The app was design based on my personal assumptions, pain points and needs, so it would need to be validated with real user testing, to see if other users are having the same issues and if the design solutions created, help them achieve their end goals.

To solve the different pain points the users were having and design the features to solve them, I decided to follow a modified version of Jeff Gothelf’s Lean UX process. Based on the initial assumptions, I made two proto-personas, Ana and Alex. Then, using the sub-hypothesis statements, I started working on a list of features that would serve each of their pain points and needs.

**The final design includes:**

* Advanced faceted search and filtering to allow users to find movies.
* Save movies for later.
* In-app movie reviews and ability to follow favorite reviewers.
* Membership plans with multiple benefits.
* Guest checkout experience.
* Segmented, highly optimized checkout flow.

##Previous Assumptions

* Users have difficulties searching and finding movies.
* Users have to exit the app, or website, to read reviews for the movie they would like to watch.
* They have difficulties viewing the movie trailers as they don’t always load correctly.
* Users can’t purchase movie tickets without having to sign up, no guest checkout experience is available.
* Users that like to watch many movies each month, feel that the tickets are too expensive.
* The UI is overloaded with adds.
* Main CTA’s don't stand out or are unclear to what will happen if they are pressed.

Based on these assumptions I created two proto-personas to create the features that would solve their pain points and needs.

##Proto–Personas

###Ana

She is a cinema enthusiast that would like to watch several movies each month without having to spend too much money. She doesn't mind signing up for a membership plan if it provides the right benefits to her.
