## Overview

Like most people, I love seeing movies. Especially in a cinema. However, each
time I used one of my local cinema’s app or website to try to buy a ticket for a
movie, I found that they all had outdated and confusing designs. Furthermore, if
I didn’t know which movie I’d like to see, I always had to use Google or other
websites to find out more about the movie.

That’s why I decided to see how I could improve the experience of searching for
a movie and then buying a ticket for it using an iOS App.
